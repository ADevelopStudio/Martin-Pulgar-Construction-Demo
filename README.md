## Requirements:
* App needs to have the design as per the screen below
* 1st functional button in this app is the ‘add a photo’ button, it will allow you to add photos on iOS, it will then fill the site diary 
* 2nd functional button in this app is ‘Next’ button which will post the data and images to a web service
